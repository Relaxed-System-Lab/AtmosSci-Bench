In the case of steady, frictionless motion along latitude circles, the momentum equation (2.20) simplifies to a cyclostrophic balance form: 
u^2 * tan(φ) / a = -(1 / ρ) * (∂p / ∂y).

By converting this expression into isobaric coordinates, demonstrate how the thermal wind equation can be represented as:
ω_r^2(p1) - ω_r^2(p0) = -(R * ln(p0 / p1)) / (a * sin(φ) * cos(φ)) * (∂⟨T⟩ / ∂y),
where R is the gas constant, a is the planet's radius, and ω_r ≡ u / (a * cos(φ)) is the relative angular velocity.

How should the vertically averaged temperature ⟨T⟩ change with latitude to ensure that ω_r is solely a function of pressure?

Given that the zonal velocity at approximately 60 km altitude above the equator (p1 = 0.005 Pa) is 100.0 m/s and the zonal velocity is zero at the planet's surface (p0 = 0.05 Pa), what is the difference in the vertically averaged temperature between the equator and the pole, assuming ω_r depends only on pressure?

In the case of steady, frictionless motion along latitude circles, the momentum equation (2.20) simplifies to a cyclostrophic balance form:

By converting this expression into isobaric coordinates, demonstrate how the thermal wind equation can be represented as:
