The root zone soil moisture should not surpass field capacity \u03b8fc during irrigation, as exceeding \u03b8fc results in drainage losses of water and fertilizer. Under this strategy, soil moisture stays below field capacity, with evapotranspiration being the sole loss from the root zone. Assuming the absence of rainfall, the temporal changes in average soil moisture \u03b8 in the root zone are described by the soil water balance equation:\n\nZ * d\u03b8/dt = -et,\n\nwhere Z represents the depth of the root zone. This implies that variations in stored water within the control volume (i.e., the root zone) arise from the disparity between water inputs and outputs. In this scenario, there are no inputs from rainfall, and the only outflow is due to et. The irrigation period (i.e., the interval between successive irrigation applications) is determined by integrating the soil water balance equation from time t=0, when \u03b8=\u03b8fc (immediately after irrigation), to time ti, when \u03b8=\u03b80 (indicating it's time to irrigate again). This assumes the evapotranspiration rate decreases linearly from the potential rate PET at \u03b8 = \u03b8fc to zero at \u03b8 = \u03b8w (i.e., et = PET*(\u03b8 - \u03b8w)/(\u03b8fc - \u03b8w)):\n\nDetermine the irrigation period ti given:\nZ=0.4 m, PET=6.0 mm/day, \u03b8fc=0.19, \u03b8w=0.05, and \u03b80=0.1.", "response": "**Final Answer**: \\[ \\boxed{D} \\]", "expected_answers": {"a": "D"}, "extracted_answers": {"a": "D"}, "evaluation": [{"id": "a", "is_correct": true, "expected_answer": "D", "extracted_answer": "D", "evaluations": {"mcq": {"is_correct": true, "expected": "D", "extracted": "D", "error": null}}}], "score": 1.0, "correct_count": 1, "total_count": 1}

The root zone soil moisture should not surpass field capacity \u03b8fc during irrigation, as exceeding \u03b8fc results in drainage losses of water and fertilizer. Under this strategy, soil moisture stays below field capacity, with evapotranspiration being the sole loss from the root zone. Assuming the absence of rainfall, the temporal changes in average soil moisture \u03b8 in the root zone are described by the soil water balance equation:\n\nZ * d\u03b8/dt = -et,\n\nwhere Z represents the depth of the root zone.

The root zone soil moisture should not surpass field capacity \u03b8fc during irrigation, as exceeding \u03b8fc results in drainage losses of water and fertilizer. Under this strategy, soil moisture stays below field capacity, with evapotranspiration being the sole loss from the root zone. Assuming the absence of rainfall, the temporal changes in average soil moisture \u03b8 in the root zone are described by the soil water balance equation:\n\nZ * d\u03b8/dt = -et,\n\nwhere Z represents the depth of the root zone.

In this scenario, there are no inputs from rainfall, and the only outflow is due to et. The irrigation period (i.e., the interval between successive irrigation applications) is determined by integrating the soil water balance equation from time t=0, when \u03b8=\u03b8fc (immediately after irrigation), to time ti, when \u03b8=\u03b80 (indicating it's time to irrigate again).

{"id": "MCQ_102_7", "question": "In regions where irrigation is applied to boost agricultural output, maintaining soil water content above the permanent wilting point (e.g., \u03b8 \u2265 2 \u03b8w) during the growing season is essential. The root zone soil moisture should not surpass field capacity \u03b8fc during irrigation, as exceeding \u03b8fc results in drainage losses of water and fertilizer. Under this strategy, soil moisture stays below field capacity, with evapotranspiration being the sole loss from the root zone. Assuming the absence of rainfall, the temporal changes in average soil moisture \u03b8 in the root zone are described by the soil water balance equation:\n\nZ * d\u03b8/dt = -et,\n\nwhere Z represents the depth of the root zone. This implies that variations in stored water within the control volume (i.e., the root zone) arise from the disparity between water inputs and outputs. In this scenario, there are no inputs from rainfall, and the only outflow is due to et. The irrigation period (i.e., the interval between successive irrigation applications) is determined by integrating the soil water balance equation from time t=0, when \u03b8=\u03b8fc (immediately after irrigation), to time ti, when \u03b8=\u03b80 (indicating it's time to irrigate again). This assumes the evapotranspiration rate decreases linearly from the potential rate PET at \u03b8 = \u03b8fc to zero at \u03b8 = \u03b8w (i.e., et = PET*(\u03b8 - \u03b8w)/(\u03b8fc - \u03b8w)):\n\nDetermine the irrigation period ti given:\nZ=1.9 m, PET=1.4 mm/day, \u03b8fc=0.3, \u03b8w=0.12, and \u03b80=0.24.", "response": "To determine the irrigation period \\( t_i \\), we start with the soil water balance equation and the given evapotranspiration (ET) model.
