This assumes the evapotranspiration rate decreases linearly from the potential rate PET at \u03b8 = \u03b8fc to zero at \u03b8 = \u03b8w (i.e., et = PET*(\u03b8 - \u03b8w)/(\u03b8fc - \u03b8w)):\n\nDetermine the irrigation period ti given:\nZ=0.4 m, PET=6.0 mm/day, \u03b8fc=0.19, \u03b8w=0.05, and \u03b80=0.1.", "response": "To determine the irrigation period \\( t_i \\), we need to integrate the soil water balance equation given the conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Soil Water Balance Equation\nThe soil water balance equation is:\n\\[ Z \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -et \\]\nGiven that \\( Z = 0.4 \\) m, we can rewrite it as:\n\\[ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -\\frac{et}{0.4} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Express Evapotranspiration Rate \\( et \\)\nThe evapotranspiration rate \\( et \\) is given by:\n\\[ et = PET \\left( \\frac{\\theta - \\theta_w}{\\theta_{fc} - \\theta_w} \\right) \\]\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ et = 6.0 \\left( \\frac{\\theta - 0.05}{0.19 - 0.05} \\right) = 6.0 \\left( \\frac{\\theta - 0.05}{0.14} \\right) = 42.857 (\\theta - 0.05) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Substitute \\( et \\) into the Soil Water Balance Equation\n\\[ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -\\frac{42.857 (\\theta - 0.05)}{0.4} = -107.1425 (\\theta - 0.05) \\]\n\n### Step 4: Separate Variables and Integrate\nSeparate the variables and integrate:\n\\[ \\int_{\\theta_0}^{\\theta_f} \\frac{d\\theta}{\\theta - 0.05} = -107.1425 \\int_0^{t_i} dt \\]\n\\[ \\ln(\\theta - 0.05) \\Bigg|_{\\theta_0}^{\\theta_f} = -107.1425 t_i \\]\n\\[ \\ln(\\theta_f - 0.05) - \\ln(\\theta_0 - 0.05) = -107.1425 t_i \\]\n\\[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\theta_f - 0.05}{\\theta_0 - 0.05} \\right) = -107.1425 t_i \\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Limits of Integration\nAt \\( t = 0 \\), \\( \\theta = \\theta_{fc} = 0.19 \\).\nAt \\( t = t_i \\), \\( \\theta = \\theta_0 = 0.1 \\).\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n\\[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{0.1 - 0.05}{0.19 - 0.05} \\right) = -107.1425 t_i \\]\n\\[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{0.05}{0.14} \\right) = -107.1425 t_i \\]\n\\[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{5}{14} \\right) = -107.1425 t_i \\]\n\\[ \\ln \\left( 0.3571 \\right) = -107.1425 t_i \\]\n\\[ -0.9808 = -107.1425 t_i \\]\n\\[ t_i = \\frac{0.9808}{107.1425} \\approx 0.00914 \\text{ days} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Correct the Calculation\nThe above calculation seems incorrect as the result is not matching any of the given options.

However, for the purpose of solving the problem, we will proceed with the given values.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Proportions\nThe proportion of new water in the streamflow can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{new_water_fraction} = \\frac{C_n}{C_t} \\]\n\\[ \\text{new_water_fraction} = \\frac{3.1}{40.99} \\approx 0.0756 \\]\n\nThe proportion of old water can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{old_water_fraction} = 1 - \\text{new_water_fraction} \\]\n\\[ \\text{old_water_fraction} = 1 - 0.0756 \\approx 0.9244 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Matching with Given Options\nThe calculated fractions are approximately:\n- new_water_fraction: 0.0756\n- old_water_fraction: 0.9244\n\nNone of the given options exactly match these values. However, the closest option is:\n- A. new_water_fraction: 0.094 , old_water_fraction: 0.906\n\nGiven the slight discrepancy, we can conclude that the closest match is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**: \\[ \\boxed{A} \\]", "expected_answers": {"a": "D"}, "extracted_answers": {"a": "A"}, "evaluation": [{"id": "a", "is_correct": false, "expected_answer": "D", "extracted_answer": "A", "evaluations": {"mcq": {"is_correct": false, "expected": "D", "extracted": "A", "error": null}}}], "score": 0.0, "correct_count": 0, "total_count": 1}

The key concept here is the use of chloride mass balance, which helps in determining the contributions of new and old water to the streamflow.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Chloride Mass Balance\nChloride mass balance is a method used to estimate the proportion of new and old water in a stream. The basic idea is that the chloride concentration in the stream (C_t) is a combination of the chloride concentration in the new water (C_n) and the old water (C_o).\n\n### Step 2: Setting Up the Equation\nThe equation for chloride mass balance is:\n\\[ C_t = C_n + (C_o - C_n) \\cdot \\text{old_water_fraction} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Substituting the Given Values\nGiven:\n- \\( C_n = 17.9 \\) \u03bcmol/L\n- \\( C_o = 55.9 \\) \u03bcmol/L\n- \\( C_t = 52.1 \\) \u03bcmol/L\n\nSubstitute these values into the equation:\n\\[ 52.1 = 17.9 + (55.9 - 17.9) \\cdot \\text{old_water_fraction} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the Equation\n\\[ 52.1 = 17.9 + 38 \\cdot \\text{old_water_fraction} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Solving for old_water_fraction\n\\[ 52.1 - 17.9 = 38 \\cdot \\text{old_water_fraction} \\]\n\\[ 34.2 = 38 \\cdot \\text{old_water_fraction} \\]\n\\[ \\text{old_water_fraction} = \\frac{34.2}{38} \\]\n\\[ \\text{old_water_fraction} = 0.8999999999999999 \\approx 0.9 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculating new_water_fraction\nSince the total fraction must sum to 1:\n\\[ \\text{new_water_fraction} = 1 - \\text{old_water_fraction} \\]\n\\[ \\text{new_water_fraction} = 1 - 0.9 \\]\n\\[ \\text{new_water_fraction} = 0.1 \\]\n\n### Step 7: Verifying the Options\nThe calculated fractions are:\n- new_water_fraction: 0.1\n- old_water_fraction: 0.9\n\nThese values match option A.\n\n**Final Answer**: \\[ \\boxed{A} \\]", "expected_answers": {"a": "A"}, "extracted_answers": {"a": "A"}, "evaluation": [{"id": "a", "is_correct": true, "expected_answer": "A", "extracted_answer": "A", "evaluations": {"mcq": {"is_correct": true, "expected": "A", "extracted": "A", "error": null}}}], "score": 1.0, "correct_count": 1, "total_count": 1}

However, the question asks about the time it takes to reach the surface, which implies a change in depth. This suggests that the submarine is not neutrally buoyant in the context of the question but is moving towards the surface.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Movement\nThe submarine is moving with an easterly speed of 10.0 m/s.

Therefore, the submarine will not move vertically unless there is an external force applied.\n\nGiven these points, the submarine will remain at the same depth of 416.0 m and will not reach the surface unless some external force (like a change in buoyancy or a change in the submarine's density) is applied.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**:\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The submarine is neutrally buoyant and stationary at 416.0 m depth.\n2. **Horizontal Speed**: The easterly speed of 35.7 m/s does not affect the vertical motion.\n3. **Vertical Motion**: Since the submarine is neutrally buoyant, there is no vertical acceleration, and thus no vertical motion.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe submarine will not move vertically and will remain at 416.0 m depth.

Therefore, if a Kelvin wave is moving along the East African coast, it will move in the north-south direction.\n\n**Direction**: North (assuming the wave is moving from south to north along the coast)\n\n### Part b: Rossby Deformation Radius\n\nThe Rossby deformation radius (Rd) is given by the formula:\n\\[ R_d = \\frac{H_0}{f} \\]\nwhere \\( H_0 \\) is the depth of the water layer and \\( f \\) is the Coriolis parameter.\n\nFor midlatitude regions, the Coriolis parameter \\( f \\) is approximately:\n\\[ f = 2 \\Omega \\sin(\\phi) \\]\nwhere \\( \\Omega \\) is the Earth's angular velocity (approximately \\( 7.292 \\times 10^{-5} \\) rad/s) and \\( \\phi \\) is the latitude.\n\nAt 45.5\u00b0 latitude:\n\\[ f = 2 \\times 7.292 \\times 10^{-5} \\times \\sin(45.5\u00b0) \\]\n\\[ f \\approx 2 \\times 7.292 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 0.711 \\]\n\\[ f \\approx 1.034 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{rad/s} \\]\n\nGiven \\( H_0 = 4360 \\, \\text{m} \\):\n\\[ R_d = \\frac{4360}{1.034 \\times 10^{-4}} \\]\n\\[ R_d \\approx 4182777.74 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nThis value is closest to option C's Rossby deformation radius.\n\n### Part c: Time to Propagate\n\nThe time \\( \\tau \\) required for a Kelvin wave to travel a distance \\( d \\) is given by:\n\\[ \\tau = \\frac{d}{v} \\]\nwhere \\( v \\) is the velocity of the Kelvin wave. For Kelvin waves, the velocity \\( v \\) is approximately:\n\\[ v \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{g H_0}{f}} \\]\nwhere \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \\( 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)).\n\nUsing the values:\n\\[ v \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{9.81 \\times 4360}{1.034 \\times 10^{-4}}} \\]\n\\[ v \\approx \\sqrt{427680000} \\]\n\\[ v \\approx 20681 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nGiven \\( d = 8540 \\, \\text{km} = 8540000 \\, \\text{m} \\):\n\\[ \\tau = \\frac{8540000}{20681} \\]\n\\[ \\tau \\approx 41293.35 \\, \\text{s} \\]\n\nThis value matches option C's time to propagate.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Final Answer**: \\[ \\boxed{C} \\]", "expected_answers": {"a": "A"}, "extracted_answers": {"a": "C"}, "evaluation": [{"id": "a", "is_correct": false, "expected_answer": "A", "extracted_answer": "C", "evaluations": {"mcq": {"is_correct": false, "expected": "A", "extracted": "C", "error": null}}}], "score": 0.0, "correct_count": 0, "total_count": 1}

The velocity \\( U \\) is already in meters per second (m/s), and the length \\( L \\) is in meters (m). The eddy viscosity \\( A \\) is in meters squared per second (m^2/s).\n\nNow, let's plug in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ek} = \\frac{(1.0 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\times (415,000 \\, \\text{m})^2}{\\nu \\times 137,000 \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}} \\]\n\nSince the kinematic viscosity \\( \\nu \\) is not explicitly given, we can approximate it using the eddy viscosity \\( A \\).

{"id": "MCQ_89_9", "question": "A submarine that is neutrally buoyant and stationary is submerged at a depth of 186.0 m at a latitude of 54.9\u00b0. Upon hearing an unusual noise to the east, the SONAR operator alerts the captain, who chooses to investigate. With an easterly speed of 45.5 m/s, how much time will pass before the submarine reaches the surface if no adjustments are made to the controls?", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the principles of buoyancy and the motion of the submarine. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Buoyancy\nA neutrally buoyant submarine means that the buoyant force equals the gravitational force acting on the submarine. This implies that the submarine is neither sinking nor rising, and it is in a state of equilibrium at the depth of 186.0 m.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Motion\nThe submarine is moving eastward with a speed of 45.5 m/s. However, the question asks for the time it will take to reach the surface, which implies that the submarine is moving vertically. Since the submarine is neutrally buoyant, it will not change its depth unless acted upon by an external force (like a change in the submarine's buoyancy or a change in the water's density).\n\n### Step 3: Considering the Depth and Speed\nThe submarine is at a depth of 186.0 m and is moving horizontally at 45.5 m/s. The depth does not change because the submarine is neutrally buoyant. Therefore, the horizontal speed does not affect the vertical motion.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Time to Reach the Surface\nSince the submarine is neutrally buoyant and there is no vertical force acting on it (no change in buoyancy or water density), the submarine will remain at the same depth of 186.0 m. Therefore, it will never reach the surface.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nGiven that the submarine will not change its depth and will remain at 186.0 m, it will never reach the surface. This means the time to reach the surface is infinite, which is not one of the given options.\n\nHowever, if we interpret the question as asking how long it would take to travel the horizontal distance to the surface (which is not possible given the conditions), we can still use the given options to find the closest logical answer.\n\nSince the submarine is not moving vertically, the time to reach the surface is not dependent on the horizontal speed. The correct answer should be the one that does not make sense in the context of the problem, which is the one that represents a time that is not infinite.\n\n**Final Answer**: \\[ \\boxed{C} \\]", "expected_answers": {"a": "B"}, "extracted_answers": {"a": "C"}, "evaluation": [{"id": "a", "is_correct": false, "expected_answer": "B", "extracted_answer": "C", "evaluations": {"mcq": {"is_correct": false, "expected": "B", "extracted": "C", "error": null}}}], "score": 0.0, "correct_count": 0, "total_count": 1}
