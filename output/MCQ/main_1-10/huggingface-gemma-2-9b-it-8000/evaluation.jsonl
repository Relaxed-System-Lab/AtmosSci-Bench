Use the SCS Method to estimate the excessive precipitation for a total of 61.1 inches of rainfall in this watershed. State clearly all your assumptions.

Calculate the weighted average CN for each land use type:**\n\n* **Good condition open space/lawn:**\n    * CN_A = 39 (given)\n    * CN_C = 74 (given)\n    * Weighted CN = (0.67 * 39) + (0.33 * 74) = 25.93 + 24.42 = 50.35\n* **Forest land with fair cover:**\n    * CN_C = 73 (given)\n\n**2. Calculate the total area weighted CN (CN_T):**\n\n* CN_T = (0.94 * 50.35) + (0.06 * 73) = 47.329 + 4.38 = 51.709\n\n**3. Calculate the initial abstraction (Ia):**\n\n* Ia = 0.2S (given)\n* We need to find S (the potential maximum retention) using the following formula:\n    * S = 25400 / CN_T\n    * S = 25400 / 51.709 = 491.9 inches\n\n* Now, calculate Ia:\n    * Ia = 0.2 * 491.9 = 98.38 inches\n\n**4. Calculate the excess precipitation (P):**\n\n* P = Rainfall - Ia\n* P = 61.1 inches - 98.38 inches = -37.28 inches\n\n**5. Interpret the result:**\n\nThe negative value for P indicates that the watershed can retain all the rainfall (61.1 inches) and more, meaning there is no excess precipitation.

This implies we need to consider the relationship between wind patterns, the aircraft's heading, and the Coriolis effect.\n\n**Key Concepts**\n\n* **Geostrophic Winds:** These winds blow parallel to isobars (lines of constant pressure) and are a result of the balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force.\n* **Coriolis Effect:** This apparent force deflects moving objects (like air masses and aircraft) to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Its magnitude is proportional to the object's speed and the Earth's rotation rate (f).\n\n**Solution Approach**\n\n1. **Visualize the Situation:** Imagine a map with isobars. Since the wind is blowing due east (90\u00b0), the isobars must be oriented north-south.\n\n2. **Aircraft's Motion:** The aircraft is flying at 10\u00b0 east of north. This means it's not directly aligned with the geostrophic wind.\n\n3. **Coriolis Effect:** Due to the Coriolis effect, the aircraft will experience a deflection to the right (in the Northern Hemisphere). This deflection will cause the aircraft to climb or descend depending on its position relative to the isobars.\n\n4. **Rate of Change in Altitude:**  The rate of change in altitude is directly related to the magnitude of the Coriolis deflection.  We can use the following formula to estimate this:\n\n   * **Vertical Velocity (w) = (f * V * sin(\u03b8))**\n\n   Where:\n    * f = Coriolis parameter (1e-05 s^-1)\n    * V = Aircraft's speed relative to the air (200 m/s)\n    * \u03b8 = Angle between the aircraft's heading and the geostrophic wind (90\u00b0 - 10\u00b0 = 80\u00b0)\n\n5. **Calculate and Interpret:**  Substitute the values into the formula and calculate the vertical velocity.

Assuming that the circulation, outside the near-surface boundary layer, is zonally symmetric (independent of x) and inviscid (and thus conserves absolute angular momentum about the Earth's rotation axis), and that it leaves the boundary layer at 16\u00b0S with zonal velocity u=0 m/s, calculate the zonal wind in the upper troposphere at (a) the equator, (b) at 13\u00b0N, and (c) at 22\u00b0N.\n", "response": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe're dealing with the Hadley circulation, a large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern driven by the uneven heating of the Earth's surface.  Key points:\n\n* **Zonally Symmetric:** The circulation pattern is the same around the Earth (east-west).\n* **Inviscid:** We're ignoring friction, meaning there are no energy losses due to air resistance.\n* **Absolute Angular Momentum Conservation:**  Air parcels conserve their angular momentum as they move around the Earth.\n\n**Key Equation**\n\nThe conservation of absolute angular momentum (AAM) is crucial here. It states:\n\n*  *mvr = constant*\n\nWhere:\n\n* *m* is the mass of the air parcel\n* *v* is the tangential velocity (velocity in the direction of the Earth's rotation)\n* *r* is the distance from the Earth's axis of rotation\n\n**Applying the Equation**\n\n1. **At 16\u00b0S (u = 0 m/s):**  The air parcel starts with zero zonal velocity.\n\n2. **At other latitudes:** As the air parcel moves poleward, its distance from the Earth's axis (r) decreases. To conserve AAM, its tangential velocity (v) must increase.\n\n3. **Calculating Zonal Wind:** The zonal wind is the component of the wind blowing east-west. We can relate it to the tangential velocity (v) using:\n\n* *u = v*cos(latitude)*\n\n**Solving for the Zonal Wind**\n\nYou'll need to use the AAM equation and the relationship between zonal wind and tangential velocity to calculate the zonal wind at the equator, 13\u00b0N, and 22\u00b0N.  The calculations involve trigonometry and the Earth's radius.\n\n**Note:**  The specific numerical values in the answer choices will depend on the exact values used for the Earth's radius and the latitude angles.\n\n\nAnswer:  \n", "expected_answers": {"a": "D"}, "extracted_answers": {"a": "C"}, "evaluation": [{"id": "a", "is_correct": false, "expected_answer": "D", "extracted_answer": "C", "evaluations": {"mcq": {"is_correct": false, "expected": "D", "extracted": "C", "error": null}}}], "score": 0.0, "correct_count": 0, "total_count": 1}

Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe have an atmosphere with a constant lapse rate (temperature change with height).  The surface temperature changes by a fixed amount (\u03b4T), but the surface pressure remains constant. We need to find the expression for how pressure changes with height (\u03b4p) due to this temperature change and then determine the height where the pressure change is maximum.\n\n**2.

This balance is crucial for understanding pressure variations with height.\n* **Ideal Gas Law:** Relates pressure, temperature, and density of a gas.\n\n**3.

Putting it Together**\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \u03c1(h) and T(h) into the hydrostatic equilibrium equation and integrating, we get an expression for p(h).  Then, we can find the pressure change \u03b4p = p(h) - p\u2080.\n\n**5.

The relationship is:\n\n\u03c1 = \u03c1\u2080 * exp(-z/H)\n\nWhere:\n\n* \u03c1\u2080 is the density at sea level.\n* H is the scale height (approximately 8 km for the Earth's atmosphere).\n\n2. **Calculate Partial Derivative:**  Take the partial derivative of \u03c1 with respect to z:\n\n\u2202\u03c1/\u2202z = -\u03c1\u2080/H * exp(-z/H)\n\n3. **Substitute and Solve:** Substitute the expression for \u2202\u03c1/\u2202z into the simplified equation and solve for w.
